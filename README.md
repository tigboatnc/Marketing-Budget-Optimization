# Marketing Budget Optimization 
Modern marketing campaigns are heavily biased towards influencer based marketing systems due to distrust in the traditional marketing streams. However the availability of multiple streams with each their own nuances and target demographics makes choosing the appropriate combination of streams a challenging task. 
Recent studies have shown that there are more than 37 million influencers only on the Instagram platform and there are even other platforms such as YouTube, Facebook which operate on a similar if not higher scale. 
The task of allotting budget to a marketing campaign is also complicated due to a two way effect between the stream and the brand as the stream and the brand share consequences and benefits making the decision of choosing an advertisement stream as extremely crucial and missing on required due diligence can have massive effects on the brand. 
It is mathematically hard to predict how effective a stream is but studies like have shown that we can use stream communication metrics such as mentions and retweets/post responses can be used to approximate how effective and likable a stream can be. 
The main goal for this project is to allocate a budget to specific streams so as to maximize the interaction between the audience and the brand. 

This report is heavily based on practical usage so it uses numerous mathematical formulations to target different aspects of the problem and provide a flexible framework for the problem statements such as : 
1. Allocate a budget that maximizes views for a given budget
2. Allocate a budget that focuses on high quality streams. .
